**SI 206 Final Project**

  For my final project, I decided to track who liked and commented on my posts the most on Facebook. In addition, I created another file to find data on what day and what time of day my posts are. I created two tables, one to show who liked and commented on my posts the most and another to show what time of day and what days I posted the most. To display this data, I used plotly to create three visualizations. I decided bar graphs would be the easiest way to show the data for each table. I made two bar graphs that show who comments on my posts the most and who likes my posts the most. Then, I made another bar graph that showed which time of day I posted the most, which was the “middle of the night” or between midnight and 3:59AM.

   I used information that I learned in SI106, SI206 and from research online for my project. For my FinalProj206.py file, I use OAuth authorization which allows a third party website to access one’s Facebook information without logging in. When running the code, it opens a webpage with a link for the user to copy into terminal to verify their account information. My code then uses the data to track information on who comments and likes my posts. For my other file, facebookposts.py, I analyzed what time of day I post the most. This code runs without requiring a verification link because it does not use OAuth authorization. Overall, I enjoyed working on this project and was happy to use what I’ve learned in both python classes I’ve taken in the school of information for the project. Below are the links to my graphs:
